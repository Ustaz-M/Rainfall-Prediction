ðŸŒ§ Rainfall Prediction Using Machine Learning

This repository presents a Rainfall Prediction System developed with machine learning and deployed using Streamlit. The project leverages weather data and predictive modeling to estimate rainfall levels, providing a practical tool for agriculture, climate research, and disaster preparedness.

The interactive application (app.py) allows users to manually input key weather parameters such as temperature, humidity, pressure, wind speed, sunshine, cloud cover, and more. These inputs are processed into a trained regression-based model (rainfall_prediction_model.pkl), which outputs the predicted rainfall amount in millimeters. The prediction is displayed instantly through a user-friendly web interface, making the system accessible to both technical and non-technical users.

The notebook (Rainfall_Prediction_using_Machine_Learning.ipynb) documents the complete data science workflow: data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation. This ensures the project is transparent, reproducible, and extendable for further experimentation.
